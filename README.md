# GraphAnalysis-HateSpeechDetection

A project I did to utilize the theoretical knowledge I gained via my studies.\
• Computed betweenness and closeness centrality measures as well as implemented biased pagerank computation algorithm to rank nodes on graphs.\
• Evaluated graphical attributes like clustering coefficient, edge bridges and articulation points of Facebook-like graphs using the SNAP library.\
• Performed hate speech detection on 5000+ tweets using vectorization methods and classifiers like random forest, SVM and supervised FastText.
