# GraphAnalysis-HateSpeechDetection

A project I did to utilize the theoretical knowledge I gained via my studies.\
• Studied the working of different python parsing algorithms such as CYK, Earley, LALR and Tree-less LALR to check syntactical correctness of C code.\
• Formulated extensive grammar for parsing codes written in the C programming language in Extended Backus-Naur form as a reference for the parser.\
• Parsed C codes using grammar specified above and the Earley and LALR parsers available in the Lark library with the ability to pinpoint syntax errors.
